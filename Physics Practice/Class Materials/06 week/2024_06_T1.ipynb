    "\n",
    "I can slide a flat piece of metal weighing 800 g with a well controlled but initial speed of 10 km/h. When I slide it downwards, it comes to a full stop after 81 cm. When I slide it upwards, it comes to a full stop after 21 cm. What is the coefficient of friction $\\mu$ and the angle $\\alpha$? (6p)\n",

    "\n",
    "A steel spring, which can push or pull, is lying on the ground, near a vertical wall, perpendicular to the wall. One end is fixed to the wall, on the free end a mass is attached that can slide on the ground, with friction. If I pull the mass away from the wall, because of static friction, it can still be in equilibrium, even if it is nudged ever so slightly - as long as the spring is stretched by no more than 10 cm. If the spring is stretched by more than that, even if the mass is in equilibrium to start with (due to static friction), if it is nudged, it will be pulled towards the wall, and eventually stop because the friction forces dissipate the energy. How far do I need to pull it from the wall, so that it comes to a stop exactly at the position where the spring is unstretched? (4p)\n",

    "($\\rho = 1.024 $ g/cm$^3$). At time $t=0$ the motor stops working. The submarine keeps moving, due to its inertia, but, under the effect of viscous friction, it is gradually slowed down. The friction force on the submarine is well approximated by Stokes' law,  \n",

    "How far will the submarine go before it stops? \n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is hard to solve analytically. Try to solve it numerically, calculating the x(t) and v(t) curves using Newton's 2nd law, for \"long enough\" time. The only force you need to take into account is the viscous friction force, since under water, the gravitational pull of the Earth and the buoyancy force cancel each other out. As the submarine slows down, the friction force decreases, and the submarine never truly \"stops\" -- but still, there is a distance $x$ that it only reaches in the $t\\to\\infty$ limit. Try to find this distance $x$.\n",

The ramp starts from a certain height, there is a straight part sloping down with angle $\\alpha$, which serves to accelerate the car to a velocity $v_0$. Then there is a curved part at the bottom (circle segment, with radius of curvature $R$) that ends in a part that is angled up at angle $\\alpha$. Neglecting friction, the car leaves the ramp with velocity $v_1=v_0$ (energy conservation). If the coefficient of friction between car and ramp is $\\mu$, what is the velocity of the car, $v_1$, when it leaves the ramp?\n",
